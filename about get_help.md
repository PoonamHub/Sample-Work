#Help Information Extraction Script#

This script is designed to extract help information from a dictionary structure and save it into text files for documentation purposes. It processes two types of elements: containers and classes, each containing relevant details and elements.
The get_help.py script generates two text files, help_all_container1.txt and help_all_class.txt, containing extracted help information from a provided dictionary structure. Here's a README text to explain the purpose and functionality of the script:

##Script Functionality##

The script performs the following steps:

Extract Container Information: It iterates through the dictionary's 'cont1' key and extracts information for each container. For each container, it writes the container's name and lists its elements along with their help text.

Extract Class Information: It iterates through the dictionary's 'classes' key and extracts information for each class. For each class, it writes the class name, brief description, related links (if available), details (if available), and lists its elements along with their help text.

Writing to Text Files: The extracted information is written to two separate text files: help_all_container1.txt and help_all_class.txt.

###Output Files###

help_all_container1.txt: Contains help information extracted from container elements.
help_all_class.txt: Contains help information extracted from class elements.

###Usage###

Ensure you have the dictionary structure containing the necessary help information.
Run the script to extract the help information and generate the text files.
Review the generated text files to access the extracted help information for containers and classes.

###Note###

The script assumes the input dictionary structure is correctly formatted and contains the required keys and values.
Any errors encountered during extraction may result in incomplete or missing information in the output text files.
